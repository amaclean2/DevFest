  bio: "This talk is aimed at addressing the meaning of full autonomy, and what it takes to develop a fully self-driving system end to end. It dives into the various subsystems that form a fully self driving system, such as building 3D maps, identifying and classifying various objects and perceiving their characteristics using sensors and cameras, predicting what other objects might do next using machine learning and determining what our reaction should be using speed and geometry constraints. This talk also presents the components of a good multi-layered testing framework which makes fully autonomous driving a safe and comfortable reality, including the digitization of the real-world driving using simulation tools. The last section of the talk presents some challenging real-world problems that engineers face while developing these systems, and gives the audience an opportunity to engage with the speaker on some ideas to solve them.

  bio: "A design system is an ever-growing and ever-evolving source of truth for the basic parts from which entire product experiences are built from. Companies like Uber and AirBnb have switched over to this process in order to create a more cohesive product experience for their users.\n This talk will focus on how at Starcity, we developed our design system by applying Interactive Live Development making the process of development and iteration faster and more efficient. In a short coding session you will be able to see how simple it is to bring a component to life, test it, and write documentation on how to use it."
