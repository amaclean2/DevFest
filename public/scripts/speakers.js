It dives into the various subsystems that form a fully self driving system, such as building 3D maps, identifying and classifying various objects and perceiving their characteristics using sensors and cameras, predicting what other objects might do next using machine learning and determining what our reaction should be using speed and geometry constraints. This talk also presents the components of a good multi-layered testing framework which makes fully autonomous driving a safe and comfortable reality, including the digitization of the real-world driving using simulation tools. The last section of the talk presents some challenging real-world problems that engineers face while developing these systems, and gives the audience an opportunity to engage with the speaker on some ideas to solve them.
